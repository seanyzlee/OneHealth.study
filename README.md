# Description of the project: 
We understand the difficulty that peripheral countries faces when it comes to a lack of health cares and sanitations. Hence why, this project was entirely inspired by the "Health and Well-being" SDG (Sustainable Development Goal). This webapp allows user to input basic details about how they are feeling (age, gender, and relevant symptoms) and outputs the most likely diseases/sicknesses/injuries that individual may have. This is done through advanced Google AI API to analyze what might by the most, hypothetically, best preliminery diagnosis for the patient.
